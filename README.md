# üìä NumPy Fundamentals and Exercises [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.6%2B-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](LICENSE) [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://github.com/MiteshBhoir/Numpy-Learning/blob/main/numpy_1.ipynb) This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks dedicated to learning, demonstrating, and practicing core concepts and advanced techniques of the **NumPy** library in Python. **NumPy (Numerical Python)** is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. --- ## üìÇ Repository Contents | File Name | Description | Key Topics Covered | |-----------|-------------|------------------| | `numpy_1.ipynb` | Numpy Basics and Array Attributes | Creation of arrays from lists, handling mixed data types, array generation functions (`arange`, `zeros`, `ones`, `linspace`), random array creation (`rand`, `randn`, `randint`), and essential array attributes (`shape`, `size`, `dtype`, `ndim`, `T`). Includes basic array methods (`min`, `max`, `sum`, `mean`, `std`, `argmax`, `argmin`) and reshaping. | | `Numpy_2_indexing.ipynb` | Advanced Indexing, Slicing, and Operations | Detailed coverage of indexing and slicing for vectors (1D) and matrices (2D). Explores Boolean Indexing for conditional selection, fundamental array arithmetic operations, the concept of Broadcasting, and the difference between Deep and Shallow Copy in NumPy. Includes matrix operations (`@` for dot product) and array stacking/splitting (`vstack`, `hstack`, `hsplit`, `vsplit`). | | `exersises.ipynb` | Practical Numpy Exercises | Applied problems to reinforce learned concepts. Includes a challenge to validate a Sudoku board using NumPy logic and practical data manipulation questions on a student dataset (e.g., calculating averages, filtering data, updating values). | --- ## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites To run these notebooks locally, you need: - **Python** (version 3.6+) - **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** (or a compatible environment like Google Colab) - **NumPy library** Install NumPy using pip: ```bash pip install numpy ``` --- ## üöÄ Getting Started 1. **Clone the repository**: ```bash git clone https://github.com/MiteshBhoir/Numpy-Learning.git ``` 2. **Navigate to the directory**: ```bash cd Numpy-Learning ``` 3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab**: ```bash jupyter notebook ``` 4. Click on any of the `.ipynb` files to start learning and executing the code. Or, open directly in **Google Colab** using the badge above. --- ## üí° How to Use - **For Beginners**: Start with `numpy_1.ipynb` to build a solid foundation on array creation and attributes. - **Intermediate Users**: Move to `Numpy_2_indexing.ipynb` to master powerful techniques like slicing, boolean indexing, and copying. - **Practice**: Use `exersises.ipynb` to test your knowledge against real-world data manipulation and logic problems. Enjoy your journey into **scientific computing with NumPy**! üöÄ
