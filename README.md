# üìä Numpy Fundamentals and Exercises

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks dedicated to learning, demonstrating, and practicing core concepts and advanced techniques of the **NumPy** library in Python.

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

The repository is structured around progressive learning modules and practical exercises:

| File Name | Description | Key Topics Covered | 
 | ----- | ----- | ----- | 
| **`numpy_1.ipynb`** | **Numpy Basics and Array Attributes** | Creation of arrays from lists, handling mixed data types, array generation functions (`arange`, `zeros`, `ones`, `linspace`), random array creation (`rand`, `randn`, `randint`), and essential array attributes (`shape`, `size`, `dtype`, `ndim`, `T`). Also includes basic array methods (`min`, `max`, `sum`, `mean`, `std`, `argmax`, `argmin`) and **Reshaping**. | 
| **`Numpy_2_indexing.ipynb`** | **Advanced Indexing, Slicing, and Operations** | Detailed coverage of indexing and slicing for both **vectors (1D)** and **matrices (2D)**. Explores **Boolean Indexing** for conditional selection, fundamental array arithmetic operations, the concept of **Broadcasting**, and the crucial difference between **Deep and Shallow Copy** in Numpy. Also includes matrix operations (`@` for dot product) and array stacking/splitting (`vstack`, `hstack`, `hsplit`, `vsplit`). | 
| **`exersises .ipynb`** | **Practical Numpy Exercises** | A notebook featuring applied problems to reinforce learned concepts. Includes a challenge to validate a **Sudoku board** using Numpy logic and practical data manipulation questions on a student dataset (e.g., calculating averages, filtering data, updating values). | 

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To run these notebooks locally, you need:

1. **Python** (version 3.6+)

2. **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab** (or a compatible environment like Google Colab).

3. The **NumPy** library:

You can install the required library using pip:
